This web app was written by me at the age of 14 to help plan the rehearsal dates for <a href="https://jso-bremen.de"> bremen's youth symphony orchestra</a>, the orchestra I was part of, and is still used there. This app turned out to be really similar to a commercial product called <a href="konzertmeister.app">"Konzertmeister"</a> that was developed at about the same time as mine app. However, the simplicity of my app called "JSO-APP", as well as the fact that it was completely free makes it a good alternative.

<h2>Why it's not further developed</h2>
Due to my rather sparse experience in web development and programming in general at this time, I did a lot of critical mistakes during development. Therefore, maintaining the app is painful and not worth the time. However I have absolutely no regrets having done this project. It's still my most used ready-to-use real-world application, and developing it has given me invaluable learning experiences.
